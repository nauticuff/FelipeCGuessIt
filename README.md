Mini Challenge #8 - Guess It
This code asks the user to guess a number between a given range. The range is based off of difficulty.
Easy is 0-10
Medium is 0-50
Hard is 0-100
and custom lets the user set a custom range.

Peer review by : Marcel R. The program runs exceptionally well. The inclusion of functions, and data validation that makes you put the right input is really nice to see. The code and terminal layout were really nice for the eyes as well. Awesome work!
